"""L31: correlation of aegis.call lines must happen in Python, not in an Insights OR-chain.

Gate attempt 15 failed LIN_zero_orphans on `invoked_not_audited:write_audit` after a full 906s
settle. The audit line was never missing - it sat in /aws/lambda/ben-fp-write-audit at 11:02:37.666,
inside the window, carrying the case_id, the trace_id AND the execution_arn. The reader could not
see it: probed against that one log group, each `like` term matched alone and any PAIR matched, but
the three-term disjunction the reader built returned zero rows, reproducibly. The proof got weaker
the more correlation keys it had, and it lost `write_audit` - the evidence writer itself.

These tests pin the behaviour that replaced it: the server is asked only for the cheap invariant,
and key matching happens here, where it can be tested without CloudWatch.
