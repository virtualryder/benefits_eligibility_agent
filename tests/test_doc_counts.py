"""Gate: the test count quoted in the docs must match the suite that actually exists.

Why this exists. Before this gate, every count-bearing document in this repo said **101** while the
suite had grown well past it, and `docs/GATE-B-CHECKLIST.md` still carried a *pharmacovigilance*
number ("109-test suite (incl. 22 CDK assertions)") that was never true here at all. The cause was
structural: `test_release_consistency.py` gated tag references but nothing asserted a count, so every
suite change silently invalidated the docs, and a number copied in from a sibling repo had nothing to
trip over.

A reviewer who spot-checks one number and finds it wrong stops trusting the control claims too. In a
benefits-determination review - where the due-process claims are the product - that is expensive. So
the count is now machine-enforced.
