"""CI completeness gate — the security tests must actually RUN, not silently skip.

WHY THIS EXISTS: `tests/test_cdk_stacks.py` begins with `pytest.importorskip("aws_cdk")`. That is the
right behaviour for a laptop without the CDK libs installed — but CI did not install `aws-cdk-lib`, so
for a period the 13 CDK security assertions SKIPPED on every push while the build still reported green.

Silently skipped is worse than absent: the repository advertised "continuous validation" of controls
(zero-public-egress, audit tamper-Deny, no default passwords, exact-ARN IAM, single signing key, and the
R3-2 "no case or notice content in Step Functions state" assertion) that CI was not exercising at all.

These tests make that failure mode loud:
  * in CI (env `CI=true`), the CDK libs MUST be importable — otherwise fail, don't skip;
  * the CI workflow must install `cdk/requirements.txt` before running pytest;
  * `cdk/requirements.txt` must be PINNED, so an independent verifier resolves the same versions that
    were validated (an unpinned range makes their result incomparable to the recorded evidence).
