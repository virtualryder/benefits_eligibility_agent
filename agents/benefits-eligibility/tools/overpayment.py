# detect_overpayment — deterministic overpayment calculation. Given what a household actually received
# per month and what they SHOULD have received under corrected facts, over a number of months, compute
# the overpayment. NO model. Governance note: identifying an overpayment is a calculation; RECOVERING it
# (or referring it as suspected fraud) is a consequential action that must follow notice and a qualified
# human's decision — the agent recommends, it does not recover or refer.
#
# Fail-closed: refuses non-de-identified input.
